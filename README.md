# ed25519.nl
A small site that tries to keep the state of ed25519 deployment in DNSSEC.

Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## I want to update the site
Awesome, send a PR!

To test your changes:

 * Clone the repo
 * `npm install`
 * `./node_module/.bin/gatsby develop`
 * Change files in `src/` until you're happy

## TODO

 * Use markdown instead of inline html
